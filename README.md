# Project Easenovate

EASEnovate is a web application aimed to consolidate portfolios of interior designers which can be displayed for potential customers to view. The purpose of this project is to provide a dynamic platform for interior designers to update their portfolios and allow potential customers to have easy access to engage the services of these interior designers. The app also allows customers to submit a rating and review for the services they have paid for. These ratings and reviews will be updated to the interior designer's portfolio for future customers to view.
